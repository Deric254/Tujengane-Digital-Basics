Changelog - Tujengane Digital Skills (conservative layout & numbering fixes)

Date: 2025-09-13
Branch: main

Summary:
- Conservative, non-destructive fixes applied to resolve horizontal overflow on small viewports, reveal runtime-updated slide numbers, and apply a single requested welcome-link change.

Files changed (high level):

1) index.html
   - Anchored marquee left and added defensive CSS guards in embedded <style>:
     - Changed `.slogan-marquee-track` to `left: 0; max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden;` (was previously positioned to the right in some variants).
   - No content text changes.

2) Tujengane computer literacy/js/scripts.js
   - updateSlide(): visible slide counter updated to include module number (e.g., "Module 2 — Slide 3 of 10").
   - Added helper `setSidebarNumbersCL()` to format sidebar numbers as `module.slide` and invoked at load.
   - No slide content strings were changed.

3) Tujengane computer literacy/css/styles.css
   - Replaced `width: 100vw` / `max-width: 100vw` occurrences in mobile rules with `width: 100%` / `max-width: 100%`.
   - Anchored marquee to left and added `max-width`/`overflow: hidden` guards.
   - Added `box-sizing: border-box` to relevant small-screen blocks.

4) Tujengane analyst pro/css/styles.css
   - Revealed `.sidebar-item .slide-number` by ensuring `display: inline-block` and adding `min-width`, color, and font-weight so runtime-populated numbers are visible.
   - (Note: there is also `styles.css.bak` in that folder -- backups were not modified.)

5) Tujengane analyst pro/js/scripts.js
   - Updated a single welcome-card href to point to the Computer Basics page (user requested content change).
     - New target: `../computer basicss/computerbasicss.html` (relative link)

6) Tujengane data basics/css/styles.css
   - Replaced `100vw` usages in mobile rules with `100%` and added `box-sizing: border-box` where needed.
   - Anchored marquee left and added `max-width`/`overflow: hidden` guards.

7) Tujengane data basics/databasics.html
   - Updated inline mobile style block: `100vw` -> `100%`, added `box-sizing` and defensive adjustments.

8) computer basicss/computerbasicss.html
   - Replaced inline mobile style `100vw` -> `100%` and added `box-sizing: border-box` on small-screen overrides.

9) computer basicss/css/styles.css
   - Replaced mobile `100vw` / `95vw` usages with percent equivalents (`100%` / `95%`), added `box-sizing: border-box`, and ensured marquee anchor is left.

Notes & rationale:
- Avoided changing slide template strings (innerHTML) except the explicit welcome-link edit you requested.
- Replacements focused on mobile media queries and small-screen overrides where viewport-width units caused overflow/clipping.
- Left backup files (e.g., `styles.css.bak`) untouched.

Remaining / follow-ups (recommended):
- `styles.css.bak` files still contain `100vw` occurrences (these are backups; no action taken). Consider removing or updating if you plan to keep them as live styles.
- Standardize `.slide-number` visibility across all course CSS files (I updated the major ones; others appear fine but a full sweep is simple if you want it).
- Replace prompt()-based gating with a small modal for better UX and security (requires UX decision).
- Optionally centralize share/clipboard logic into a shared JS file to keep behavior consistent.

How I validated:
- Repo-wide grep for `100vw` performed before/after patches; main occurrences in active `styles.css` files replaced. Remaining matches are only in `.bak` files.
- Visual, conservative CSS edits only — nothing that would change slide text/content (except the requested welcome link change).

If you'd like, I can now:
- Run the lightweight smoke tests (quick lint/errors) and open the main pages in a simulated narrow viewport to confirm the fixes (I can provide the commands to run locally), or
- Continue and update the `.bak` files as well (if you want every file changed), or
- Revert any specific change if it's not what you expected.
